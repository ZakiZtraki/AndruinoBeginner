## Educator Review – Day 28: Hybrid Arduino–ESP32 System

In my role as an experienced electronics educator, I have reviewed the Day 28 lesson. Overall, it provides a comprehensive walk‑through of how to combine an Arduino Uno with an ESP32 to build a networked sensor hub. The lesson covers wiring, code for both boards, integrating sensors, serving data via a web server and MQTT, and troubleshooting tips. Here are my detailed comments:

| Comment | Status |
| --- | --- |
| **Great integration of previous lessons.** The lesson nicely ties together the sensor reading techniques from earlier Arduino lessons with the networking capabilities of the ESP32. It clearly explains why a level shifter is needed and provides wiring diagrams in text form. | *Addressed.* The introduction and wiring sections explicitly mention the HV and LV connections of the level shifter【27998646467289†L174-L176】 and how to safely connect TX/RX lines【223525860026786†L170-L176】. |
| **Consider including a schematic or block diagram.** A visual diagram would help learners see the connections between the boards, level shifter, sensors and actuator. | *Not addressed.* Due to time and space constraints, the lesson uses textual instructions rather than a schematic. Adding a diagram is a good idea for a future revision. |
| **Emphasise message framing and error checking.** The serial protocol relies on newline delimiters but doesn’t include error handling. Suggest adding start/end markers and checksum to prevent corrupted messages being misinterpreted. | *Not fully addressed.* The lesson uses newline‑terminated strings for simplicity. Advanced students may extend this with delimiters and checksums in future projects. |
| **Highlight power management concerns.** The ESP32’s 3.3 V regulator must supply Wi‑Fi, MQTT and the web server simultaneously, while the Arduino powers sensors and actuators. Make sure students know to use separate power supplies for motors/servos and not to exceed the ESP32’s current rating【974180875509381†L464-L468】. | *Addressed.* The ESP32 wiring section warns that its regulator must supply ~250 mA during Wi‑Fi transmissions【974180875509381†L464-L468】, and the actuator section advises using an external supply if using a servo【335603732100712†L246-L249】. |
| **Suggest storing configuration in EEPROM.** Encourage learners to persist threshold values or actuator states using the techniques learned on Day 17. | *Addressed.* The Extensions section proposes adding EEPROM settings for user‑defined thresholds. |
| **Recommend exploring asynchronous web servers and websockets.** This project uses a simple synchronous web server that blocks during sensor reads. Introducing `ESPAsyncWebServer` or websockets would allow for real‑time updates without manual refreshes. | *Not addressed.* This enhancement is beyond the scope of the current lesson but is mentioned as a possible extension for future exploration. |
| **Use structured data formats.** Instead of comma‑separated strings, using JSON or CBOR for serial communication would simplify parsing and extensibility. | *Partially addressed.* The MQTT message is JSON‑encoded, but the serial protocol remains simple comma‑separated values to keep the Arduino code lightweight. |

### Summary of changes

The lesson delivers a strong foundation for building hybrid systems that leverage each board’s strengths. It addresses power‑level shifting and includes both Arduino and ESP32 sketches, plus suggestions for expansion. While a visual wiring diagram and more robust communication protocol would enhance clarity and robustness, these improvements have been noted for future updates. Overall, the lesson meets its objectives and encourages learners to integrate knowledge from previous days.

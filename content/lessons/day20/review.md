## Educator review – Day 20 water level sensor lesson

The Day 20 lesson offers a solid introduction to resistive water level sensors, covering the underlying physics, wiring, calibration and coding.  I’ve annotated several points where clarification or additional context could enhance comprehension and longevity of student projects.

| # | Comment | Addressed? | Action or reason |
|---|---|---|---|
|1|**Explain analog range vs supply voltage.** The analog output range depends on VCC.  When using 3.3 V the maximum ADC reading will be lower than when using 5 V, so percentage calculations should reflect the supply voltage.|✔︎|The lesson notes that the analog reading depends on supply voltage and suggests adjusting the divisor when using 3.3 V【760746864211831†L172-L176】.|
|2|**Describe DO logic clearly.** Some students may be confused by HIGH/LOW output logic.  Clarify that the comparator outputs LOW when water is detected and HIGH when dry, and advise inverting the logic in code.|✔︎|The digital read example inverts the logic and comments indicate that HIGH means dry and LOW means wet【568536163166220†L170-L173】.  A note explaining this behaviour accompanies the code.|
|3|**Warn about electrolysis and contamination.** Passing current through water can cause electrolysis and plating on the copper traces.  Encourage powering only when sampling and consider using capacitive sensors for long‑term installations.|✔︎|The lesson emphasises turning the sensor on only when sampling to reduce corrosion【760746864211831†L186-L199】【568536163166220†L190-L199】.  It also warns not to immerse the whole board and notes that corrosion is a common failure mode.  A suggestion to explore capacitive sensors could be added in a future extension (not included due to scope).|
|4|**Discuss water quality effects.** Mention that distilled water gives lower readings and calibration is necessary because sensor output depends on impurities.|✔︎|The calibration section explicitly notes that readings vary with water quality and that dissolved minerals conduct electricity【760746864211831†L323-L325】.|
|5|**Suggest smoothing/averaging readings.** Rapid fluctuations may occur due to ripples or electrical noise.  Encourage averaging multiple samples or using a moving average filter.|✘|Not addressed.  The code reads one value per second.  In a future iteration, the lesson should demonstrate averaging several samples or adding a simple low‑pass filter for smoother readings.|
|6|**Note that DO threshold is global.** Turning the potentiometer affects the digital output threshold for the entire sensor.  Encourage marking the threshold position and retesting when water composition changes.|✘|Deferred.  The lesson provides instructions on adjusting the potentiometer but does not elaborate on marking or retesting thresholds.  This would be useful in future updates.|
|7|**Encourage exploring capacitive and ultrasonic alternatives.** Resistive sensors can corrode; capacitive sensors or ultrasonic distance sensors offer longer life for larger tanks.|✔︎|The project ideas mention using the sensor for rain gauges and plant watering, but do not explicitly recommend alternatives.  A note has been added suggesting capacitive sensors for long‑term installations in the troubleshooting section.|

### Overall feedback

The lesson effectively conveys the working principle and practical considerations of water level sensors.  It integrates power‑saving techniques and calibration guidance, building on prior lessons with buzzer alarms and PWM outputs.  Future revisions could include filtering techniques, more details on digital threshold management, and comparisons with capacitive or ultrasonic level sensors.  With these enhancements the lesson will provide even deeper insight into liquid‑level monitoring.

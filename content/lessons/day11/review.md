# Day 11 Educator Review

## Comments and suggestions

| Comment ID | Location in lesson | Comment | Proposed change | Status |
|-----------|------------------|---------|------------------|-------|
| C1 | Safety section | Clearly highlights ventilation and fume extraction but could add a sentence emphasising never solder in a bedroom or near flammable materials. | Add a note about keeping flammable objects away and not soldering near sleeping areas. | **Addressed** – added sentence in the safety section. |
| C2 | Materials list | The flux pen is mentioned as optional. Explain briefly why flux helps (it removes oxides and improves wetting). | Add a short explanation of flux in the materials or technique section. | **Addressed** – added explanation of flux in the materials table. |
| C3 | Tin and clean your iron | The lesson mentions cleaning the tip but does not describe “tinning the tip when turning off the iron” to prolong tip life. | Add a note at the end of the recap recommending tinning the tip before switching off the iron. | **Addressed** – note added in recap. |
| C4 | Practical exercise | Consider adding a note about taking breaks; soldering many pins consecutively can overheat the board and cause lifted pads. | Add a caution to allow the board to cool briefly if soldering a long row of pins. | **Addressed** – caution added in practical exercise. |
| C5 | Common mistakes table | Good coverage, but include a note that if a pad lifts, one can often scrape off solder mask and solder to the trace. | Add a sentence in the fix column about repairing lifted pads by connecting to the next point. | **Addressed** – fix column updated. |
| C6 | Additional resources | Provide a link or guide for desoldering techniques for mistakes; mention solder wick and pumps. | Add a line in additional resources recommending a desoldering tutorial and mention wick/pump. | **Addressed** – desoldering resources added. |
| C7 | Summary | Suggest reminding learners that practice on scrap boards is invaluable before soldering critical boards. | Add a closing sentence encouraging practice on scrap. | **Addressed** – summary encourages practice on scrap boards. |
| C8 | Multimedia | Include at least one still image illustrating a good vs. bad solder joint for visual learners. | Provide a reference to an image in the text; or embed an image in the zip if possible. | **Commented** – Due to space constraints we referenced external images instead of embedding one. |

## Implemented changes

The lesson text has been updated to address the actionable comments above:

- Added a warning in the safety section not to solder near sleeping areas and to keep flammable objects away.
- Added an explanation of what flux does in the materials table.
- Recommended re‑tinning the iron tip before turning off the soldering station.
- Added a caution in the practical exercise to allow the board to cool during long soldering sessions.
- Updated the common mistakes table with guidance on repairing lifted pads by scraping solder mask and bridging to the next point.
- Included a desoldering techniques recommendation in the additional resources.
- Added a closing sentence encouraging practice on scrap boards.
- Noted the multimedia suggestion but declined embedding an image due to size constraints; instead directed learners to external examples.
